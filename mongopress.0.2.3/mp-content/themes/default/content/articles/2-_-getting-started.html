<title>Getting Started with MongoPress</title>
<p>At present, the requirements for running MongoPress include PHP 5.2+, MongoDB 1.8+ and the required <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mongo.php">PHP Drivers</a> v1.1.4+</p>
<p>Setting things up is really quite simple (assuming you already have MongoDB and the MongoDB PHP Driver installed), all you will need to do is upload to a server, visit the root URL of the application, and follow the on-screen instructions. If you have the right user rights, you will be able to automatically created the necessary .htaccess and config.php files, otherwise you should get clear instructions that allow you to copy and paste the appropriate information. However, just in case, and to help clarify and document, we will outline all the settings associated with the config.php file.</p>
<p>These are the commonly configured global definitions:</p>

<h4>MONGODB_HOST</h4>
<p>This is the host address used for your MongoDB server.</p>

<p>This is the name you want to use / create for your "object" collection.</p>

<h4>OBJS_PP</h4>
<p>This is the default number of objects to display per page.</p>

<h4>MONGODB_REPLICAS</h4>
<p>This defines whether or not you wish to use replica-sets (but does not create the necessary MongoDB database configurations - it only provides support for that functionality).</p>

<p style="margin-top:25px;padding-top:15px;border-top:1px dotted #CCC;font-weight:bold;">The following options are important random security keys and are important to have and be unique, so please visit our <a href="http://mongopress.com/salt-generation.php">online key generation</a> to create as necessary:</p>

<h4>SITE_SALT</h4>
<p>This should be a unique key that is used to provide an additional layer of security to your installation.</p>
