<title>MongoPress Languages</title>

<h4>MongoPress is Fully-Translatable - Can you help Translate...?</h4>
<p>Help spread the joy of MongoPress and a world filled with NoSQL CMS platforms of all shapes and sizes by helping us to translate core, or improve upon the following supported mother-tongues:</p>
<ol>
    <li>English (1% Google Translation)</li>
    <li>Malay (20% Google Translation)</li>
    <li>Simple Chinese (100% Google-Translation)</li>
</ol><br />
<p>As you can see, we need that help we asked for earlier...</p>

<h4>Alright I'm ready lets do it.. How do I get started?</h4>
<p>If you are looking to help translate core, simply navigation to "mp-languages/source.po", could the file and rename to your new language, then hack away. We recommend <a href="http://www.poedit.net/download.php">POedit</a>, and if you're a first-time user or looking to translate your theme or plugin, the following guidelines may help:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click "File" -> "New Catalog", a Settings window should appear.</li>
    <li>In the first tab "Project Info", name your project <emphasis>(MongoPress or any other easily identifiable name)</emphasis></li>
    <li>In the second tab "Paths", click the dotted rectangle icon on the right "New Item", <br />type in the full destination to the folder where the .po files are located on your machine</li>
    <li>In the third tab "Keywords", same as above, click "New Item" and type"__", create a second item with "_e"</li>
    <li>Hit "OK" to close the dialog box and we're good to go!</li>
    <li>Open any .po file and you can start translating.</li>
    <li>When you save .po files, they are converted into a new .mo file - which is the file that we really need (but cannot edit directly).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Auto-Language Detection from Browser</h4>
<p>We also have a somewhat crude but functioning auto-language detection system in place that will try to automatically load the correct language file based upon your internal settings and the available MO files, so please, the more core translations we can use, the better this feature can become.</p>
