<title>The Key-Features of MongoPress</title>
<h4>It's Open Source</h4>
<p>Thanks to the generous <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPLv3</a> license, just like WordPress - it's entirely OpenSource. Members of <a href="http://labs.laulima.com">Lau-Labs</a> have full access to <a href="http://trac.mongopress.org">MongoTrac</a>, to submit their own tickets and patches, whereas the general public are free to keep track of development or grab the latest source directly from <a href="http://svn.mongopress.org/">SVN</a>.</p>

<h4>It's Extremely Fast &amp Instantly Scalable</h4>
<p>MongoDB makes traditional caching a thing of the past due to its lightening fast reflexes. With out-of-the-box support for back-ups and load-balancing through replication-sets and sharding, there is no other CMS currently available that offers the same instant scalability.</p>

<h4>It's Incredibly Secure &amp Search-Engine Friendly</h4>
<p>Developed by a team who are actively using the platform on live projects and who take security, SEO and modern adaptive, dynamically responsive design and development very seriously, you can be certain that our boilerplates will remain up-to-date. We have employed SHA(256) encryption for salted-passwords that are stored independently to usernames, and our default front-end and administrative themes feature intelligent HTML classes that provide important browser information whilst employing HTML5 entities and CSS3 standards throughout.</p>

<h4>It Allows for Easy Customization &amp Configuration</h4>
<p>Already featuring a working theme structure and familiar plugin methods, both the front-end and back-end is entirely customizable, and supported directly from the theme, along with content-structure-templating, which is capable of quickly importing vast amounts of HTML into MongoPress and converting folders and file names into object types and content.</p>

<h4>Fully Translatable</h4>
<p>We are also using the same language / translation API as WordPress, and have already translated the core into Bahasa Malay, Simplified Chinese and Spanish, although this was mostly done with the help of Google Translate, so please feel free to contribute more core languages.</p>

<h4>Scalable Media Storage &amp Serving</h4>
<p>Utilizing MongoDB's native GridFS functionality, images and ZIP files are stored directly in the database and automatically sharded and replicated whilst MongoPress also tracks the views and downloads of associated files.</p>

<h4>It's Developer Friendly &amp Familiar</h4>
<p>Since the plugin API (add_action and add_filter), formatting API and language API are directly imported from WordPress, developers who are already familiar with WordPress will surely feel right at home, and be quick to develop new and engaging concepts that can truly take advantage of the new technologies and standard that become easily accessible when running MongoPress.</p>
