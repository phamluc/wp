<title>Introducing MongoPress - The High-Performance, Object Based NoSQL CMS</title>
<p>MongoPress is an instantly scalable, incredibly flexible CMS that uses MongoDB and PHP to deliver a powerful object-oriented environment that is flexible and free. It is not only freely licensed and distributed under a generous <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> license, but it is also free from the constraints that many of the leading MySQL-based CMS platforms suffer from. MongoPress was in many ways inspired by <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, and was originally planned as a plugin, but after realizing that WordPress had been built from the ground-up as a table-based MySQL-driven architecture, providing MongoDB support was not going to be an easy task, and in some ways, even seemed to defeat the point of a NoSQL environment.</p>

<h4>What is NoSQL and this MongoDB you keep harping-on about...?</h4>
<p>In computing, NoSQL is a broad class of database management systems that differ from classic relational database management systems (RDBMSes) in some significant ways. These data stores may not require fixed table schemas, and usually avoid join operations and typically scale horizontally. <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> is amongst the most powerful of this new breed of NoSQL database. It's an easily scalable high-performance OpenSource document-oriented database featuring a whole host of functions that are ideally suited to the new ways we use and engage with media and the web. They have exceptional out-of-the-box functionality for replication, load-balancing, geo-location and media-storage. Able to handle thousands of concurrent connections and rendering traditional methods of caching obsolete; NoSQL standards are here to stay, and will soon make MySQL a distant fading memory, especially in-light of recently <a href="http://labs.laulima.com/category/benchmarks/">published benchmarks</a>, where MongoDB performed at least <strong>8,000 times faster</strong> than MySQL.</p>

<h4>What is wrong with WordPress...?</h4>
<p>Firstly, let us be clear by stating our unconditional love for WordPress. Unfortunately, without some serious hardware and a whole bunch of tweaking, it does not scale well - and by it, we really mean MySQL, so perhaps the most prominent problem with WordPress is its reliance on SQL.</p>
<p>You may be thinking well why does WordPress not adopt this, or other NoSQL databases, and the answer is quite simple; <strong>shared-hosting environments do not YET support MongoDB</strong>, and until they do, main-stream adoption would not be possible. However, we could not hang-around for two or three years waiting for MongoDB to be fully supported - so MongoPress was born!</p>

<h4>What exactly is MongoPress and how stable is it...?</h4>
<p>MongoPress is a CMS, for it's a system that manages content, but its primary goal will always remain the same; be as lightweight as possible. We do not want to make any assumptions as to what it will be used for, so merely want to concentrate on making its foundations as stable and flexible as possible. It does however have a powerful set of core-features that are needed to achieve and drive these goals. This includes perma-trails, GridFS media storage, geo-proximity queries, and fully working themes and plugins. It's completely translatable, and anyone familiar with WordPress will feel right at home.</p>
<p>MongoPress has been specifically designed to function as a CMS framework, where we will continue to work on providing the absolute fastest and most secure way of accessing and manipulating web-based content whilst allowing you to create your own platforms, applications and sites in any way you see fit. You can add, edit and delete objects and objects can be anything you like, from posts, pages and comments, to places, projects, contacts and more. Everything but the absolute essentials have been stripped-out and made accessible via the heavily filterable core.</p>
<p>Please note that MongoPress is in its extreme infancy and incredibly beta stages of development. Although it is already being used in several production environments and will in-turn benefit from rapid development, every effort has been made to secure the application, but <a href="http://laulima.com">we</a> nonetheless make no claims that it is ready for prime-time and should be used and or reviewed at your own risk! :-)</p>
