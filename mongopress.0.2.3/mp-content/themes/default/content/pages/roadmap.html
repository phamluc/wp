<title>The Semi-Official MongoPress Roadmap</title>
<p>We will continue to update this page as and when someone remembers to bug someone about making the changes, for in-truth, should you desire a more accurate idea of exactly what is going-on at MongoPress HQ, you should check-out <a href="http://trac.mongopress.org/trac/report/3">MongoTrac</a> or the <a href="http://lauli.ma/mp">MongoPress Lau-Labs Project</a>.</p>

<h4 style="color:#757575">THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE KEY FEATURES <span style="color:#333;">ALREADY</span> INCLUDED IN VERSION 0.2:</h4>

<h4>Fully-Functioning Perma-Trail System</h4>
<p>Rather than simply replicating the WordPress permalink system, we decided to take things one step further, and allow you to use forward slashes, in -turn creating virtual structures without having to categorize things. In addition to this, are perma-trails are intelligent, and if you tried to visit the URL of a sub-folder and no objects are found to match the final part of the slug, the system will search and display objects matching the same folder structure. You can also use the final part of the slug as a number to limit the results, and assign a specific query_perma_key to use as a direct filter for returning sets of objects. It really is quite amazing and is something we will be expanding upon in future releases.</p>

<h4>Basic Theme Framework in Place</h4>
<p>Although we are planning to save the fancy theme GUI for version 0.2, we do already have a working theme system that can be accessed through the silent options hidden away in the configuration file.</p>

<h4>Plugin Functionality Utilizing WP-Like Action Hooks and Filters</h4>
<p>The same fancy plugin GUI will be added to version 0.2, but in the meantime, simply add your plugin to the "mu-plugins" folder for it to be automatically activated and used. Sound familiar? Indeed, we're using the same plugin API as WordPress, so building plugins using add_action and add_filter will be a breeze for existing WordPress developers.</p>

<h4>Fully Translatable Utilizing WP-Like _e('to echo') and __('too return') Methods</h4>
<p>We are also using the same language / translation API as WordPress, and have already translated the core into Bahasa Malay, Simplified Chinese and Spanish, although this was mostly done with the help of Google Translate, so please feel free to contribute more core languages.</p>

<h4>GridFS Media Support for Images and ZIP Files</h4>
<p>Store and serve images and ZIP files directly from MongoDB using native GridFS functionality, and let MongoPress track views and downloads in real time without worrying about caching!</p>

<h4>Modern HTML5 Core Structure with Advanced Adaptive Design</h4>
<p>Our team is somewhat fanatical and modern standards and have from the out-set ensured that all our pages are constructed in HTML5 with CSS3 and a firm eye towards adaptive design. All pages generated by MongoPress include important HTML classes that help developers understand the browser better, in conjunction with HTML5 forms, you will find that our boilerplates remain at the very edge of awesomeness!</p>

<h4>"Mother-Proofed" Easy Installation Wizards</h4>
<p>We felt it was important that the first version be as easy as possible to install, so our inline installation wizards have been fully tested on a wide variety of users, and although we are unable to guarantee that they are totally idiot-proof, we we strive to make the experience more and more enjoyable as we continue to develop the project. However, we should point out the installation is only a simple task once you have already managed to figure out how to set-up the following requirements - PHP 5.2+, MongoDB Server 1.8+, and MongoDB PHP Drivers 1.4.1+</p>

<h4>Full Replica-Set and Sharding Support</h4>
<p>Several of the mouth-watering features MongoDB provides includes automated continuous back-ups and load-balancing, which is done natively though the MongoDB replica-sets and sharding features, which we have baked into core as configurable options and fully-tested from day one. This provides out-of-the-box instant scalability!</p>

<h4>Geo-Location Support</h4>
<p>From adding lat / lng coordinates to objects via custom fields, geoRSS and proximity queries, our native geo-location support is second to none.</p>

<h4>WYSIWYG-Editing and Custom Fields</h4>
<p>Although we have a long-way to go when it comes to making the process of adding and editing objects, we already have "data-views" and "publishing-view" and have started working on versions of the administration functions that will be fully customizable from the theme, as we feel that other developers and or users should be able to manage their content anyway they wish.</p>

<h4>Content Templates</h4>
<p>As noted above with the up-coming "admin" feature available to theme-designers, perhaps one of our most under-rated yet truly powerful feature is the "content" templating system, which is also accessed from themes. This function can search for the "content" folder in your theme and will create object types based upon the folders inside that folder, and within each of those inner folders, it will then search for HTML files and directly import those files as objects with the specified object-type, content, title, priority, etc. The speed at which MongoDB can handle this is incredible, and allows for easy development, design and deployment of live sites from one environment to the next. It really is a site that needs to be seen with your own eyes!</p>

<h4>Mingo Meantime and other Planet Mongo References</h4>
<p>Although the process of reaching our first public release was slightly stressful and heavy on the shoulders, we insisted that we made time to have some fun, and half way through development, we switched the style of our brand when we realised that there was a planet Mongo that already existed, and that it had cool catch-phrases such as "Mingo-Meantime" and "Unidentified Object in the Imperial Vortex", it also turned-out to be a movie that several of us already consider pretty damn-cool, so off we went...</p>

<h4 style="color:#757575">THESE ARE SOME OF THE MORE EXCITING FEATURES CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR THE NEXT RELEASE:</h4>

<h4>Multi-User Support and Roles</h4>
<p>At the moment, there is functionality for multiple-users, but it is hidden from site. The next version will include accessible ways to add and edit user information, along with role-management.</p>

<h4>Theme and Plugin Management GUI</h4>
<p>We will certainly be adding all the bells and whistles at the first opportunity we get, but we'll at all times consider flexibility, customisation and simplicity.</p>

<h4>Advance GridFS Media Support</h4>
<p>HTML5 Audio and Video storage and playback is our most anticipated feature for the next release.</p>

<h4>HTML and JS Templating</h4>
<p>Our most internally-requested feature for the next release is to provide the ability for themes to be developed in HTML and JS and remove PHP as a theme development requirement.</p>

<h4>Import and Export from MySQL and WordPress</h4>
<p>We want to be able to make importation and exportation of data to be as simple as possible, but are really hoping that over developers come to our aid on this so that we can focus on other priorities...</p>
