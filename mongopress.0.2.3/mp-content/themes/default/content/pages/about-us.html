<title>About MongoPress</title>
<h4>How did it all start...?</h4>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mongopress" class="twitter">MongoPress</a> is developed and maintained by <a href="http://twitter.com/laulimadotcom" class="twitter">Laulima</a> and is licensed and distributed with the same generous <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> freedoms offered by WordPress. Originally conceived by <a href="http://twitter.com/m_smalley" class="twitter">Mark Smalley</a> out of frustration with the poor performance and scalability of MySQL, the first thoughts that came to mind were to direct all information from WordPress to MongoDB, but that would have been an epic task in light of their current core structure and reliance upon SQL based queries. The thought of then forking WordPress and only changing the core files needed to fully utilise MongoDB came to mind, but after digging deeper into MongoDB functionality and structure, it quickly became apparent that anyone diving-in to this new NoSQL landscape had a chance to do things different. After demonstrating the blazing speeds and simplicity of a concept code-named "mongopress", used to showcase the possibilities of a NoSQL-based CMS to <a href="http://twitter.com/ali_watters" class="twitter">Ali the Evil Overlord</a>, it quickly became apparent and agreed upon that  <a href="http://twitter.com/laulimadotcome" class="twitter">we</a> ourselves had that very opportunity, and so we decided to set-out and create something more suited to the new ways in which we engage with media on the web.</p>

<h4>Who are Laulima...?</h4>
<p><a href="http://laulima.com">Laulima</a> develop interactive geo-social solutions relevant to life's endeavours.  We are a self-funded start-up based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - with international leadership and a wealth of technical experience across a wide range of web technologies. At the time of starting MongoPress, we had had exactly two days experience with MongoDB, so we by no means claim to be Mongo-Specialists, but we do plan to plunge full-steam ahead and whole-heartedly into the world of MongoDB-backed web-based content and management for all of our on-going projects.</p>
<p>As a result, we are extremely confident that this framework will quickly grow into a sleek and utterly indispensable tool for anyone interested in self-hosted MongoDB-powered web applications or implementations.</p>
