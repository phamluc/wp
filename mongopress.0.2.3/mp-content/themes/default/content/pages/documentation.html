<title>MongoPress Documentation</title>
<p>We have not yet had the chance to discuss how or well we will manage the official support channels for this project, but internally, we use a combination of the <a href="http://lauli.ma/mp">MongoPress Project Page</a> at <a href="http://lauli.ma/labs">Lau-Labs</a> and what we like to call <a href="http://trac.mongopress.org/trac/report/3">MongoTrac</a>, which is where we keep track of out-standing bugs and future feature requests. Many of the areas inside <a href="http://trac.mongopress.org/trac/report/3">MongoTrac</a> are fully accessible to the general public, but certain roles such as submitting new tickets are limited to moderated members and personal invites of the <a href="http://lauli.ma/labs">Lau-Labs</a> network, so please get in touch through the <a href="http://lauli.ma/labs">labs</a> or directly with <a href="http://laulima.com">Laulima</a> - we'd also love to hear from you on <a href="http://twitter.com/mongopress">Twitter</a> and look forward to the possibilities of some extremely collaborative community awesomeness. Ninjas and Rockstars are Superheros and Evil Overlords here on Planet Mongo!</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">That's not to say that we have left you completely empty handed - far from it...</p>
<p>Not only have we written-up a few useful articles, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://mongopress.org/perma-trails/">Introducing Perma-Trails</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://mongopress.org/building-themes/">Building Themes for MongoPress</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://mongopress.org/building-plugins/">Building Plugins for MongoPress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have also provided everything that you see on this website as a working "default" theme included at core.</p>
<p>A theme with MongoPress can also include the very structure of the site, from the types of objects you want to start with and the HTML content of those objects can all be included within a "content" folder in your theme and then optionally imported directly into MongoPress.</p>
<p>A theme with MongoPress can also include the administration pages, styles, and actions permissable with your current project, done by adding files to an "admin" folder in your theme.</p>
<p>Themes are flexible in that they can use any type of object in any location and return the content of the object in any number of ways.</p>
<p>URLs are intelligent, and creating virtual sub-folders and then automating searches and queries based on these virtual folder and other pre-defined configurable perma_keys is really quite amazing.</p>
<p>Images and ZIP files can be stored and served directly from the database using native GridFS functionality, where views and download counts are automatically tracked by MongoPress.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">And all of this is included in core as a way for you to understand how things work...</p>
<p>Yes, that's right, you are going to have to get your hands dirty at this point, but then, so are we. This is a relatively new technology being applied in new uncharted ways, so hold on to your hats and enjoy the ride!</p>
