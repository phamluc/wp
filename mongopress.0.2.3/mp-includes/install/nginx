## Put the line below in nginx php.conf
fastcgi_param  HTTP_MOD_REWRITE		On;

## Put the line below in nginx server config
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;

## Performance Note
Change from using tcp to unix socket and save them to /dev/shm (memory filesystem)
edit your php-fpm.conf and change 
listen = 127.0.0.1:9000 
to
listen = /dev/shm/php5-fpm.sock

You also need to change your nginx server config from
location ~ \.php$ {
 fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
}

to

location ~ \.php$ {
 fastcgi_pass unix:/dev/shm/php5-fpm.sock;
}
